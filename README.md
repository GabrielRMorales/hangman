This is the classic hangman game coded as part of The Odin Project. 

The computer loads a dictionary of words and selects a word between 5 and 12 letter. 

Players must guess the word, one letter at a time, before their chances run out.

Each turn, the game displays the word in progress and incorrectly guessed letters.
